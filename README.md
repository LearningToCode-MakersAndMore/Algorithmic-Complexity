# Algorithmic Complexity

## Description
Code for timing algorithms and improving their efficiency specifically with regards to time and memory complexity.

## Tasks
â€¢ Write a program to time the execution of a function. The program should take a function and feed in multiple inputs of increasing size and output the time taken for each input to be processed and the respective size of the input.
