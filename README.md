# Algorithmic Complexity

## Description
Code for timing algorithms and improving their efficiency specifically with regards to time and memory complexity.

## Tasks
* Write a program to time the execution of a function. The program should take a function and feed in multiple inputs of increasing size and output the time taken for each input to be processed and the respective size of the input.

### Steps
* Write function that can accept any function as an argument
* Add a second parameter to the existing function to pass the input parameter and have the input default to an empty array. 
* Modify function to output time taken to execute the passed function.
